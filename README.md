# league-of-legends-bot-poc
Manual and automated imagine analysis based primitive bot for league of legends

Only reads some character stats, can move around the map, essentially clicks the screen, takes screenshots, analyses them and tries to make a call

There's a start on identifying targets but no machine learning in-place to recognize/differenciate targets - recognize skills or buy items
